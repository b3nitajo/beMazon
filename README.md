# What is beMazon?
BeMazon is an server side storefront built using node.js, inquirer and mySQL database. This app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

# How it works?

First, install required dependencies. Run js file and follow prompts. 

Purchase products and get order totals while product's inventory updates accordingly. 

Once a product is out of stock, it will deactivate and become unorderable.
